# cid

Node.js based CI utilizing docker.

## What does this CI do?

This CI is built to be small and do one thing. Run tests on all repositories in a repo.

I designed this with Github Classroom and mind, which makes a *new* repo for every assignment. I couldn't find a CI that could run on all repos, so here we are!

## Setup (WIP)

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

## Other Parts of this:

[ci](https://github.com/programmingandlogic/ci) - ci test runner (client)

[karel](https://github.com/programmingandlogic/karel) - test case designed to run for now.
